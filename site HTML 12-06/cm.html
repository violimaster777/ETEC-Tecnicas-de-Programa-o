					<h3>Cloud Nine</h3><br><br>
If you want to live, let live<br>
if you want to go, let go<br>
I'm not afraid to dream- to sleep, sleep forever<br>
I don't need to touch the sky<br>
I just want to feel that high<br>
And you refuse to lift me<br>

Guess it wasn't real after all<br>
Guess it wasn't real all along<br>

If I fall and all is lost<br>
It's where I belong<br>

If you want to live, let live<br>
If you want to go, let go<br>
I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender<br>

Guess it wasn't real after all<br>
Guess it wasn't real all along<br>

If I fall and all is lost<br>
No light to lead the way<br>
(Never thought that it would end up this way)<br>
Remember that all alone is where I belong<br>

In a dream<br>
Will you give your love to me?<br>
Beg my broken heart to beat<br>
Save my life<br>
Change my mind<br>

If I fall and all is lost<br>
No light to lead the way<br>
(Never thought that it would end up this way)<br>
Remember that all alone is where I belong<br>
