					<h3>All That I'm Living For</h3><br><br>
All that I'm living for<br>
All that I'm dying for<br>
All that I can't ignore alone at night<br>

I can feel the night beginning<br>
Separate me from the living<br>
Understanding me<br>
After all I've seen<br>
Piecing every thought together<br>
Find the words to make me better<br>
If I only knew how to pull myself apart<br>

All that I'm living for<br>
All that I'm dying for<br>
All that I can't ignore alone at night<br>
All that I'm wanted for<br>
Although I wanted more<br>
Lock the last open door<br>
My ghosts are gaining on me<br>

I believe that dreams are sacred<br>
Take my darkest fears and play them<br>
Like a lullaby<br>
Like a reason why<br>
Like a play of my obsessions<br>
Make me understand the lesson<br>
So I'll find myself<br>
So I wont be lost again<br>

All that I'm living for<br>
All that I'm dying for<br>
All that I can't ignore alone at night<br>
All that I'm wanted for<br>
Although I wanted more<br>
Lock the last open door<br>
My ghosts are gaining on me<br>

Guess I thought I'd have to change the world<br>
To make you see me<br>
To be the one<br>
I could have run forever<br>
But how far would I have come<br>
Without mourning your love?<br>

All that I'm living for<br>
All that I'm dying for<br>
All that I can't ignore alone at night<br>
All that I'm wanted for<br>
Although I wanted more<br>
Lock the last open door<br>
My ghosts are gaining on me<br>

Should it hurt to love you?<br>
Should I feel like I do?<br>
Should I lock the last open door?<br>
My ghosts are gaining on me<br>
