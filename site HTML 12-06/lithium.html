					<h3>Lithium</h3><br><br>
Lithium - don't want to lock me up inside<br>
Lithium - don't want to forget how it feels without<br>
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow<br>
oh but God I want to let it go<br>

come to bed, don't make me sleep alone<br>
couldn't hide the emptiness you let it show<br>
never wanted it to be so cold<br>
just didn't drink enough to say you love me<br>

I can't hold on to me<br>
wonder what's wrong with me<br>

Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside<br>
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without<br>
lithium- I want to stay in love with my sorrow<br>
oh...<br>

Don't want to let it lay me down this time<br>
drown my will to fly<br>
here in the darkness I know myself<br>
can't break free until I let it go<br>
let me go<br>

Darling, I forgive you after all<br>
anything is better than to be alone<br>
and in the end I guess I had to fall<br>
always find my place among the ashes<br>

I can't hold on to me<br>
wonder what's wrong with me<br>

Lithium- don't want to lock me up inside<br>
lithium- don't want to forget how it feels without<br>
lithium stay in love with you<br>
oh I'm gonna let it go<br>
