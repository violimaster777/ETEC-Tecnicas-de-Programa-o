					<h3>Lacrymosa</h3><br><br>
Out on your own<br>
Cold and alone again<br>
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?<br>

Blame it on me<br>
Set your guilt free<br>
Nothing can hold you back now<br>

Now that you're gone<br>
I feel like myself again<br>
Grieving the things I can't repair and willing...<br>

To let you blame it on me<br>
And set your guilt free<br>
I don't want to hold you back now love<br>
I can't change who I am<br>
Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me<br>
And in this short life<br>
There's no time to waste on giving up<br>
My love wasn't enough<br>

And you can blame it on me<br>
Just set your guilt free, honey<br>
I don't want to hold you back now love<br>

(Lacrimosa dies illa,<br>
Qua resurget ex favilla judicandus homo reus.<br>
Huic ergo parce, Deus.<br>
Pie Jesu, domine dona eis requiem. Am√©n)<br>
