					<h3>Weight of the World</h3><br><br>
Feels like the weight of the world<br>
Llike God in heaven gave me a turn<br>
Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you<br>
Still in the dark, can you fix me?<br>

Freefall, freefall, all through life<br>

If you love me, then let go of me<br>
I won't be held down by who I used to be<br>

She's nothing to me<br>

Feels like the weight of the world<br>
Like all my screaming has gone unheard<br>
And ohm I know you don't believe in me<br>
Safe in the dark, how can you see?<br>

Freefall, freefall, all through life<br>

If you love me, then let go of me<br>
I won't be held down by who I used to be<br>

If you love me, then let go of me<br>
I won't be held down by who I was...<br>

If you love me, then let go of me<br>
I won't be held down by who I used to be<br>
