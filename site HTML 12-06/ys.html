					<h3>Your Star</h3><br><br>
I can't see your star<br>
I can't see your star<br>
Though I patiently waited, bedside<br>
for the death of today<br>
I can't see your star<br>
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away<br>

And I'm alone now<br>
Me and all I stood for<br>
We're wandering now<br>
All in parts in pieces, swim lonely<br>
Find your own way out<br>

I can't see your star<br>
I can't see your star<br>
How can the darkness feel so wrong?<br>

And I'm alone now<br>
Me and all I stood for<br>
We're wandering now<br>
All in parts in pieces, swim lonely<br>
Find your own way out<br>

So far away<br>
Its growing colder without your love<br>
Why can't you feel me calling your name?<br>
Can't break the silence<br>
Its breaking me<br>

All my fears turn to rage<br>

And I'm alone now me<br>
And all I stood for<br>
We're wandering now<br>
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely<br>
Find your own way out<br>

Now, Nothing worth fighting for<br>
We're wandering now<br>
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely<br>
Find your own way out<br>
