					<h3>The Only One</h3><br><br>
You know you're not the only one<br>
When they all come crashing down (midflight)<br>
You know you're not the only one<br>
When they're so alone they find<br>
A back door out of life<br>
You know you're not the only one<br>

We're all grieving<br>
Lost and bleeding<br>

All our lives<br>
We've been waiting<br>
For someone to call our leader<br>
All your lies<br>
I'm not believing<br>
Heaven shine a light down on me<br>

So afraid to open your eyes (hypnotized)<br>
You know you're not the only one<br>
Never understood this life<br>
And you're right I don't deserve<br>
But you know I'm not the only one<br>

We're all grieving<br>
Lost and bleeding<br>

All our lives<br>
We've been waiting<br>
For someone to call our leader<br>
All your lies<br>
I'm not believing<br>
Heaven shine a light down on me<br>

Don't look down<br>
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you<br>
Don't look down<br>
You'll fall down<br>
You'll become their sacrifice<br>
Right or wrong<br>
Can't hold on to the fear<br>
That I'm lost without you<br>
If I can't feel, I'm not mine,<br>
I'm not real<br>

All our lives<br>
We've been waiting<br>
For someone to call our leader<br>
All your lies<br>
I'm not believing<br>
Heaven shine a light down on me<br>
