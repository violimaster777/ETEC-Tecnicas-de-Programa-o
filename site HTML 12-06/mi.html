					<h3>My Immortal</h3><br><br>
					I'm so tired of being here<br>
					Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
					And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave<br>
					'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
					And it won't leave me alone<br>
					These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
					This pain is just too real<br>
					There's just too much that time cannot erase<br>
					When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
					When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
					And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
					But you still have all of me<br>
					You used to captivate me by your resonating light<br>
					Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind<br>
					Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<br>
					Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me<br>
					These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
					This pain is just too real<br>
					There's just too much that time cannot erase<br>
					When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
					When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
					And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
					But you still have all of me<br>
					I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone<br>
					But though you're still with me<br>
					I've been alone all along<br>
					When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
					When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
					And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
					But you still have all of me<br>
