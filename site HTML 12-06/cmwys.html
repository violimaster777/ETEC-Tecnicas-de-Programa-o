					<h3>Call Me When You're Sober</h3><br><br>
Don't cry to me<br>
If you loved me<br>
You would be here with me<br>
You want me, come find me<br>
Make up your mind<br>

Should I let you fall<br>
And lose it all?<br>
So maybe you can remember yourself<br>
Can't keep believing<br>
We're only deceiving ourselves<br>
And I'm sick of the lies<br>
And you're too late<br>

Don't cry to me<br>
If you loved me<br>
You would be here with me<br>
You want me, come find me<br>
Make up your mind<br>

Couldn't take the blame<br>
Sick with shame<br>
Must be exhausting to lose your own game<br>
Selfishly hated<br>
No wonder you're jaded<br>
You can't play the victim this time<br>
And you're too late<br>

So don't cry to me<br>
If you loved me<br>
You would be here with me<br>
You want me, come find me<br>
Make up your mind<br>

You never call me when you're sober<br>
You only want it cause it's over<br>
It's over<br>

How could I have burned paradise?<br>
How could I?<br>
You were never mine<br>

So don't cry to me<br>
If you loved me<br>
You would be here with me<br>
Don't lie to me<br>
Just get your things<br>
I've made up your mind<br>
