					<h3>Snow White Queen</h3><br><br>
Stoplight lock the door<br>
Don't look back<br>
Undress in the dark<br>
And hide from you<br>
All of you<br>

You'll never know the way your words have haunted me<br>
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me<br>
You don't know me, now and ever<br>

You belong to me<br>
My Snow White Queen<br>
There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over<br>
Soon I know you'll see<br>
You're just like me<br>
Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you<br>

Wake up in a dream<br>
Frozen fear<br>
All your hands on me<br>
I can't scream<br>

I can't escape the twisted way you think of me<br>
I feel you in my dreams and I don't sleep<br>
I don't sleep<br>

You belong to me<br>
My Snow White Queen<br>
There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over<br>
Soon I know you'll see<br>
You're just like me<br>
Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you<br>

I can't save your life<br>
Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting<br>
I'm losing my mind<br>
And you just stand there and stare as my world divides<br>

You belong to me<br>
My Snow White Queen<br>
There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over<br>
Soon I know you'll see<br>
You're just like me<br>
Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you<br>
All I want is you<br>
All I want is you<br>
All I want is you<br>
