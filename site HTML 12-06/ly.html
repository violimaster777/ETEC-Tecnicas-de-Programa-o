					<h3>Like You</h3><br><br>
Stay low<br>
Soft, dark, and dreamless<br>
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness<br>
I hate me<br>
For breathing without you<br>
I don't want to feel anymore for you<br>

Grieving for you<br>
I'm not grieving for you<br>
Nothing real love can't undo<br>
And though I may have lost my way<br>
All paths lead straight to you<br>

I long to be like you<br>
Lie cold in the ground like you<br>

Halo<br>
Blinding wall between us<br>
Melt away and leave us alone again<br>
Humming, haunted somewhere out there<br>
I believe our love can see us through in death<br>

I long to be like you<br>
Lie cold in the ground like you<br>
There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you<br>
I'm coming for you<br>

You're not alone<br>
No matter what they told you you're not alone<br>
I'll be right beside you forevermore<br>

I long to be like you, sis<br>
Lie cold in the ground like you dear<br>
There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you<br>
And as we lay in silent bliss<br>
I know you remember me<br>
I long to be like you<br>
Lie cold in the ground like you<br>
There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you<br>
I'm coming for you<br>
