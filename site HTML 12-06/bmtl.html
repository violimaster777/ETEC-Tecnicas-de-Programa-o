					<h3>Bring Me To Life</h3><br><br>
How can you see into my eyes<br>
like open doors<br>
leading you down into my core<br>
where I've become so numb?<br>
Without a soul;<br>
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold,<br>
until you find it there and lead it back home.<br>

(Wake me up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(I can't wake up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
(Wake me up. )<br>
Bid my blood to run.<br>
(I can't wake up. )<br>
Before I come undone.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Save me from the nothing I've become.<br>

Now that I know what I'm without<br>
you can't just leave me.<br>
Breathe into me and make me real.<br>
Bring me to life.<br>

(Wake me up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(I can't wake up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
(Wake me up. )<br>
Bid my blood to run.<br>
(I can't wake up. )<br>
Before I come undone.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Save me from the nothing I've become<br>

Bring me to life.<br>
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)<br>
Bring me to life.<br>

Frozen inside without your touch,<br>
without your love, darling.<br>
Only you are the life among the dead.<br>

All of this time<br>
I can't believe I couldn't see<br>
Kept in the dark<br>
but you were there in front of me<br>
I've been sleeping a one thousand years it seems.<br>
I've got to open my eyes to everything.<br>
Without a thought<br>
Without a voice<br>
Without a soul<br>
(Don't let me die here/There must be something more.)<br>
Bring me to life.<br>

(Wake me up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(I can't wake up.)<br>
Wake me up inside.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
(Wake me up. )<br>
Bid my blood to run.<br>
(I can't wake up. )<br>
Before I come undone.<br>
(Save me. )<br>
Save me from the nothing I've become.<br>

Bring me to life.<br>
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)<br>
Bring me to life.<br>
