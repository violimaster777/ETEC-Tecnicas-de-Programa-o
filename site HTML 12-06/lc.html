					<h3>Lose Control</h3><br><br>
You don't remember my name<br>
I don't really care<br>
Can we play the game your way?<br>
Can I really lose control?<br>

Just once in my life<br>
I think it'd be nice<br>
Just to lose control, just once<br>
With all the pretty flowers in the dust<br>

Mary had a lamb<br>
His eyes black as coals<br>
If we play very quiet, my lamb<br>
Mary never has to know<br>

Just once in my life<br>
I think it'd be nice<br>
Just to lose control, just once<br>

If I cut you down to a thing I can use<br>
I fear there will be nothing good left of you<br>
