					<h3>Everybody's Fool</h3><br><br>
Perfect by nature<br>
Icons of self indulgence<br>
Just what we all need<br>
More lies about a world that<br>

Never was and never will be<br>
Have you no shame don't you see me<br>
You know you've got everybody fooled<br>

Look here she comes now<br>
Bow down and stare in wonder<br>
Oh how we love you<br>
No flaws when you're pretending<br>
But now I know she<br>

Never was and never will be<br>
You don't know how you've betrayed me<br>
And somehow you've got everybody fooled<br>

Without the mask where will you hide<br>
Can't find yourself lost in your lie<br>

I know the truth now<br>
I know who you are<br>
And I don't love you anymore<br>

Never was and never will be<br>
You don't know how you've betrayed me<br>
And somehow you've got everybody fooled<br>

It never was and never will be<br>
You're not real and you can't save me<br>
Somehow now you're everybody's fool<br>
