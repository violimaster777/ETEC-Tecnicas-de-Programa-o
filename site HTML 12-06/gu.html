					<h3>Going Under</h3><br><br>
Now I will tell you what I've done for you<br>
fifty thousand tears I've cried<br>
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you<br>
And you still won't hear me<br>
(I'm going under)<br>
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself<br>
Maybe I'll wake up for once<br>
Not tormented daily defeated by you<br>
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom<br>
I'm dying again<br>

I'm going under<br>
Drowning in you<br>
I'm falling forever<br>
I've got to break through<br>
I'm going under<br>

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies<br>
So I don't know what's real and what's not<br>
Always confusing the thoughts in my head<br>
So I can't trust myself anymore<br>
I'm dying again<br>

I'm going under<br>
Drowning in you<br>
I'm falling forever<br>
I've got to break through<br>

So go on and scream<br>
Scream at me I'm so far away<br>
I won't be broken again<br>
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under<br>

I'm dying again<br>

I'm going under<br>
Drowning in you<br>
I'm falling forever<br>
I've got to break through<br>
I'm going under<br>
Going under<br>
I'm going under<br>
