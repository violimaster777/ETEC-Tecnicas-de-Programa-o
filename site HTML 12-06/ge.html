					<h3>Good Enough</h3><br><br>
Under your spell again<br>
I can't say no to you<br>
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand<br>
I can't say no to you<br>

Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly<br>
Now I can't let go of this dream<br>
I can't breathe but I feel<br>

Good enough<br>
I feel good enough for you<br>

Drink up sweet decadence<br>
I can't say no to you<br>
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind<br>
I can't say no to you<br>

Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely<br>
Now I can't let go of this dream<br>
Can't believe that I feel<br>

Good enough<br>
I feel good enough<br>
It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good<br>

And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall<br>
Pour real life down on me<br>
Cause I can't hold on to anything this<br>
Good enough<br>
Am I good enough<br>
For you to love me too?<br>

So take care what you ask of me<br>
Cause I can't say no<br>
